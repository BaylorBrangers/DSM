# DSM
This is my attempt at using various embedding and clustering techniques on subsets of mental disorders in the DSM-5. The objective is to find clusters of diseases based on clinical presenatations and to explore the different disease clusterings. Future work will aim to find treatment recommendations based on cluster membership
