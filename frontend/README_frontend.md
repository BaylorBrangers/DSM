# Disease Search Frontend

This directory contains a simple React-based user interface for searching diseases. The UI allows you to enter a disease name and returns the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment for that disease based on a small built-in dataset.

## Running

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. The page uses CDN links for React and Babel, so no additional build steps are required.
